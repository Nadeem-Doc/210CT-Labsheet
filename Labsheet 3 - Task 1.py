Takes a string as an input and returns a split list and length of list

Takes pos and sentence (which is a list)
appends the list with element at pos-1 (append automatically put
element at the back of list)
since thereâ€™s two elements (original and appended), the original
gets removed.
This is done until pos reaches 0 which returns new list
